**Solar Energy Prediction Using Machine Learning**
This project focuses on predicting solar energy generation at the G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Sciences using machine learning. With India's increasing energy demands, this study leverages solar power, a renewable resource, to address these needs. The research implements and compares four algorithms—Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost—to forecast solar energy production over a 14-day period. Data was collected from 81 Polycrystalline solar panels, and weather data was integrated to enhance prediction accuracy. The XGBoost algorithm proved to be the most accurate, with an 81% prediction accuracy. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in optimizing solar energy utilization and suggests improvements through larger datasets and hybrid models for future work.
